The configuration file contains directories leeding to BAM files containing filtered alignments, input for sequencing parameters, and instructions on where to place output files. 
The files workflow.py and the configuration file should be placed in one folder, together with a folder called 'workflow_source' containing the workflow_source.py file and the workflow_templates.py file.
